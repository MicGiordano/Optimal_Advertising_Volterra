In this example we consider the standard Volterra-Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process, with parameters as above. 
The main point is to show the difference between the advertised model V_a and the non-advertised model V_0.

Here we consider the default advertising vector u, defined as u(t) = t for t in [2,6] and 0 elsewhere.
